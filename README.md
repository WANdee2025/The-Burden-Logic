# The-Burden-Logic
# 📦 Project: Bhāra (ภารํ)
> **Early Buddhism in the Digital Age**

## 💡 Core Philosophy
**"In Short, withholding the Mind and Body is true heavy weights."**

This project is a minimalist implementation of the **Bhāra Sutta**, illustrating the Buddhist logic of the Five Aggregates (Khandha) and the liberation found in letting go.

## 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Bhāra:** The heavy burden (Five Aggregates).
- **Bhārādāna:** The act of taking up the burden (Craving/Taṇhā).
- **Bhāranikkhepana:** The act of laying down the burden (Nirvāna/Peace).

## 🚀 Usage
Run the code via Node.js to see the logic of liberation:
`node index.js`
