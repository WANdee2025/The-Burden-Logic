# 📦 Project: The-Burden-Logic
> **Early Buddhism in the Digital Age**

## 💡 Core Philosophy
**"In Short, withholding the Mind and Body is true heavy weights."**

This project is a minimalist implementation based on the ancient wisdom of the **Bhāra Sutta**. It visualizes how clinging to our physical and mental components creates "heavy weights" in our life.

## 🔑 Key Concepts (Simple English)
- **The Burden:** Our body and mind components (The Five Aggregates).
- **Taking Up:** The act of clinging or attaching (Creating suffering).
- **Laying Down:** The act of letting go (Achieving absolute peace).

## 🚀 Usage
Run the code via Node.js to see the logic of liberation:
`node index.js`
